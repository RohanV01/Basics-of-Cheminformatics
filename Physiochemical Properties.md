# Theoretical Tutorial: Physiochemical Properties and Drug Likeness of Molecules

##Introduction
In this theoretical tutorial, we will explore various physiochemical properties of molecules and how they influence the drug likeness of a compound. We will cover concepts such as SMILES notation, Molecular Weight (Mol Wt), Number of Atoms, Number of Heavy Atoms, Number of Aromatic Heavy Atoms, Number of Rotatable Bonds, Number of Hydrogen Acceptor and Donor Molecules, and Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA).

## 1. SMILES Notation
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a notation that allows us to represent chemical structures in a way that is both human-readable and can be used by computers. It provides a linear representation of a chemical structure.

## 2. Molecular Weight (Mol Wt)
Molecular Weight refers to the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in a molecule. It is expressed in atomic mass units (amu). Molecular weight is an important parameter as it affects the pharmacokinetic properties of a compound.

## 3. Number of Atoms
This parameter simply counts the total number of atoms present in a molecule. It includes all types of atoms - hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.

## 4. Number of Heavy Atoms
Heavy atoms are non-hydrogen atoms. This parameter counts the total number of non-hydrogen atoms in a molecule.

## 5. Number of Aromatic Heavy Atoms
Aromatic atoms are those that participate in an aromatic ring system (e.g., benzene ring). This parameter counts the total number of non-hydrogen atoms in aromatic rings.

## 6. Number of Rotatable Bonds
Rotatable bonds are single bonds around which free rotation is possible. This parameter is important in assessing the conformational flexibility of a molecule.

## 7. Number of Hydrogen Acceptor and Donor Molecules
These parameters are important in understanding a molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds. 
- Hydrogen Acceptor: A site in a molecule where a hydrogen atom can form a hydrogen bond.
- Hydrogen Donor: A site in a molecule where a hydrogen atom can be donated in a hydrogen bond.

## 8. Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)
TPSA is a measure of the surface area of a molecule that is polar (i.e., capable of forming hydrogen bonds). It is an important parameter in predicting a molecule's ability to cross biological membranes.

## 9. Drug Likeness
Drug likeness refers to the likelihood that a compound will possess the necessary properties to be developed into a drug. Physiochemical properties play a crucial role in determining drug likeness. Compounds with properties similar to those of known drugs are more likely to be successful in drug development.

## Conclusion
Understanding the physiochemical properties of molecules is crucial in drug discovery and development. These properties influence a molecule's pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetics, and overall drug likeness. By considering these factors, researchers can make informed decisions in the drug development process.
